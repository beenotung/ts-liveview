# Database

This session description the workflow related to `erd.txt` and database schema migration.

## Viewing database schema

You can copy the content of `erd.txt` into the [hosted web ui](https://quick-erd.surge.sh).

The hosted version store the content in LocalStorage, so the changes are persisted across page reload. You can then paste the updated version back to `erd.txt`.

In some region, it may take quite some time to load the website, you can run the web ui locally as well.

Command to run the web ui of erd locally:

```bash
npm run ui
```

The local version can auto load and save the content of `erd.txt` on your disk.

## Updating database schema (migration)

Remark: cd to `db` if not done already

Auto mode:

1. update `erd.txt` with any text editor
2. run `npm run update`

Manual mode:

1. update `erd.txt` with any text editor
2. run `npm run gen-migrate`
3. review the generated migration script in the `migrations` directory
4. run `npm run migrate`
5. run `npm run gen-proxy`

## Populating database (seeding)

You can setup configuration data and sample data in `seed.ts`, then run it with `npm run seed`.

## Why a separate package?

This package is used to isolate knex from top-level package.

We're using esm on the top-level package but knex with typescript only works in commonjs package.

The files here are compiled and imported from the server directly, so the dependencies of this package should appear on the top-level package.json as well.
