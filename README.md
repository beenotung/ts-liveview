# ts-liveview

> ts-liveview helps to deliver fast and interactive user interface directly from the node.js server.

_(Without MBs of javascript to be downloaded and executed on the client side.)_

The client-side runtime of ts-liveview is below 12KB (2.2KB bundled, minified and gzipped).

ts-liveview supports `JSX` but it **doesn't rely on Virtual DOM**. Instead, precise DOM operations are derived from application-specific event handlers, and sent to the browser client(s) for realtime UI updates.

## Get Started

```bash
npm init ts-liveview my-app
cd my-app
pnpm install	# or `yarn install` or `npm install`
pnpm dev    	# or `yarn dev`     or `npm run dev`
```

**Remarks**:

<span id='0'>[0]</span> Pay the AST-to-HTML conversion time-cost once at boot-time instead of at each request-time

<span id='1'>[1]</span> Response contentful html page directly to GET request

<span id='2'>[2]</span> Triggered by events from server or other clients

<span id='3'>[3]</span> For screen-reader, text-based browser, and people tried with privacy invading scripts

## Why JSX?

Previous versions of ts-liveview use [template string](https://github.com/beenotung/ts-liveview/blob/25f54760b378c0a0d8d2607bde4afa2878bb0ae6/test/demo-server-clock.ts#L11) to build html. It allows the engine to quickly construct the html output for [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom) to patch the DOM.

With the template string based approach, html injection _could be_ avoided when explicitly using helper function to sanitize the dynamic content. However it requires the developer to be careful, which could be bug-prone.

## Why no virtual-dom diff?

Current version updates the DOM using document query selector, this reduce the memory requirement on the server to supports simultaneous connections.

The application can be built on top of reactive model powered by [S.js](https://github.com/adamhaile/S), [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), or OOP with [getter and setter](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html). Example using _getter and setting_ see [thermostat.tsx](./server/app/pages/thermostat.tsx).
